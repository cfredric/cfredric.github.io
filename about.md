I'm a software engineer and a mathematician by training, currently working as a software engineer. I've always been interested in the intersections between math, programming, and linguistics; over time this has led me to explore different programming paradigms, learn the basics of Haskell, and dip my feet in Category Theory, as well as other things.

Aside from academic pursuits, I enjoy rock climbing, competitive swimming, and road cycling.
