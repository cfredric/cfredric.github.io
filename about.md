I'm a software engineer and a mathematician by training, currently working as a
software engineer. I've always been interested in the intersections between
math, programming, and linguistics; over time this has led me to explore
different programming paradigms, different corners of math, and different
(spoken) languages, as well as other things.

As a project to learn Haskell, I rewrote a toy number theory
[library](https://github.com/cfredric/NumberTheory) I had written in Perl
during undergrad. Out of that project came the Gaussian Integer support in
[`arithmoi`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/arithmoi).

I'm roughly conversational in French and can have basic conversations in
Swedish; at one point I could also have conversations in German, Spanish, and
Russian.

Aside from academic pursuits, I enjoy rock climbing, competitive swimming, and
road cycling.
